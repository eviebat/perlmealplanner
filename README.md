Summary:
This application is used to plan a weeks worth of meals. Start with the mealPlanner.pl file to begin your meal planning. All of the meals files are sorted by type of meal (breakfast, lunch etc). Once you've created your menu, you can select to save it or start over. By selecting 1, you save the meal file to a file titled thisWeeksMeal.txt, otherwise press any key to generate a new menu. All of the meals are selected at random. This application does not currently allow for the editing of the meal files.
